# PixelPerfect DiscountExclusion

## Overview
The PixelPerfect DiscountExclusion module provides a flexible and extensible system for preventing additional discounts on products that are already discounted in Magento 2.

## Features
- Prevent applying shopping cart rules to products with existing discounts
- Flexible strategy pattern implementation for discount exclusion
- Easily extendable with custom discount exclusion strategies
- Supports multiple exclusion criteria out of the box

## Installation
```bash
composer require pixelperfectat/magento2-module-discount-exclusion
php bin/magento module:enable PixelPerfect_DiscountExclusion
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

## Strategies
The module implements a strategy pattern that allows easy addition of discount exclusion rules.

### Default Strategies
- Special Price Strategy: Excludes products with existing special prices
- Catalog Rule Strategy: Excludes products affected by catalog price rules

### Adding Custom Strategies
To add a custom discount exclusion strategy:

1. Create a strategy class implementing `DiscountExclusionStrategyInterface`:
```php
class MyCustomDiscountStrategy implements DiscountExclusionStrategyInterface
{
    public function shouldExcludeFromDiscount(Product $product, Item $item): bool
    {
        // Custom exclusion logic
        return false; // or true based on your conditions
    }
}
```

2. Add the strategy via `di.xml`:
```xml
<type name="PixelPerfect\DiscountExclusion\Service\DiscountExclusionManager">
    <arguments>
        <argument name="strategies" xsi:type="array">
            <item name="my_custom_strategy" xsi:type="object">
                Vendor\Module\Model\Strategy\MyCustomDiscountStrategy
            </item>
        </argument>
    </arguments>
</type>
```

Alternatively, dynamically add strategies programmatically:
```php
$discountExclusionManager->addStrategy($myCustomStrategy);
```
